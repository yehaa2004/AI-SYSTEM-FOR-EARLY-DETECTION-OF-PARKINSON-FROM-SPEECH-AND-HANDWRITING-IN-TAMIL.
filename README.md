MLP + CNN Classification

📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on detecting Parkinson’s Disease using voice recordings.

Parkinson’s disease affects motor control, including muscles involved in speech production. By analyzing acoustic characteristics of voice recordings, we build deep learning models to classify:

Healthy (0)

Parkinson (1)

Two approaches were implemented:

🔹 MLP (Feature-based model)

🔹 CNN (Spectrogram-based model)

🎯 Problem Statement

To develop a deep learning system that can classify speech samples as:

Healthy

Parkinson

using acoustic features extracted from voice recordings.

📂 Dataset Description

The dataset consists of .wav speech recordings organized as:

Tamil_Parkinson_Dataset/

│
├── train/

│   ├── healthy/

│   └── parkinson/
│

├── test/

│   ├── healthy/

│   └── parkinson/

Dataset Characteristics

Type: Audio (.wav)

Sampling Rate: 16 kHz

Input to CNN: 128×128 Mel Spectrogram

Task: Binary Classification

🔬 Why Voice Data?

Parkinson’s disease affects:

Vocal stability

Pitch variation

Tremor in speech

Amplitude irregularities

Harmonic-to-noise ratio

Speech analysis provides a non-invasive diagnostic support tool.

🧾 Data Preprocessing Pipeline

1️⃣ Audio Loading

Loaded using librosa

Resampled to 16kHz

2️⃣ Mel Spectrogram Conversion

Each audio file is converted to:

128 Mel frequency bands

📈 Comparative Analysis (MLP vs CNN)

Model	Strength	Limitation
MLP	Simple, faster training	Ignores spatial structure
CNN	Captures time-frequency patterns	Higher computation

Key Insight:

CNN performs better because Mel Spectrograms contain spatial time-frequency dependencies that convolutional layers can capture effectively.
